# Empower-her--web-app

# Idea 

This website is a part of my Community connect project, the idea was to make a website as a helping aid for the girls hitting puberty. During our first cycle,we often felt intimidated by new changes, and found ourselves pondering upon questions like "Why do we get periods?" "Which sites to refer?" "How to maintain health and hygiene?" Empower-her aims to answer all these questions in all aspects of health ang hygiene practices. The app allows the girls to connect with a doctor, access the resource center and stay updated with health and hygiene practices.
